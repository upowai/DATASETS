# DATASETS for uPow Blockchain

Welcome to the DATASETS repository, a curated collection of datasets integral to the uPow blockchain ecosystem. This repository is structured to facilitate easy access to essential data files, each rigorously verified through SHA256 hash values to ensure integrity and security.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into main folders, labeled from `0` to `3`. Each folder represents a unique category or classification within the uPow blockchain framework. Inside these folders, you will find two critical components:

- **hash**: A file containing the SHA256 hash value of the accompanying dataset. This hash serves as a checksum to verify the integrity of the dataset.
- **saved**: A sub-folder that houses the actual dataset in a compressed ZIP format. Each ZIP file is approximately 10MB in size.
